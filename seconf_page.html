        <td> Earned my bachelors, graduating from Ithaca College. 
            I had no set plans after graduation which left me feeling lost for awhile. 
            Two months later I started teaching history at a charter school
            in the Bronx. Quit within seven months, and was back to square one.
        </td>
        <td> I finally figured out the field I saw myself in long-term 
            and started my graduate school application process. I only
            applied to three schools: Pratt, NYU, and Parsons. I still had no plan but 
            I remained hopeful that eveything would work itself out. After being 
            unemployed for nine months, I finally landed a job and shortly recevied my 
            acceptance from Pratt.  
        </td>
        <td>
            Now, I am currently in my first year at Pratt, enjoying every bit of it.
            I am reminded everyday that I chose the right school. Although this is just 
            my first semester, I already feel like I've learned so much. Excited to see 
            how 2024 ends.
