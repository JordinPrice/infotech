        <h4> Post Grad was an awkward time for me, but I 
            always found comfort in music, tv and my favorite foods.
            My ultimate goal was to stay out of a rut and I could always count 
            on those three things to do just that. 
            I've always connected to music alot mainly because it helps my mood, and 
            thought processes. I decided to include some of my favorite songs and albums
            that resonate with me the most. As for shows, I included the ones 
            who have charaters I relate to the most. These are shows that I typically
            rewatch as well. And I think comfort foods is explanatory. I'm just a girl who 
            likes a good meal/snack.
